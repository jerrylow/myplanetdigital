Use of administrative monetary penalties will be considered an avenue of last resort when all other compliance assistance and improvement options have been exhausted
The License Appeal Tribunal (LAT) will hear appeals from organizations of director’s orders, but not individual complaints.  Individuals who feel their human rights have not been met would continue to complain to the Ontario Human Rights Commission.</p>
