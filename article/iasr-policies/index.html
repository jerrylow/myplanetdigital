<p>Myplanet shall incorporate accessibility into public spaces that are newly constructed or redeveloped on and after January 1, 2017.

If we should we will ensure that we follow the existing requirements stated under the Design of Public Spaces Standards (Accessibility Standards for the Built Environment) for recreational trails and beach access routes, outdoor public use eating areas, outdoor play spaces, exterior paths of travel, accessible parking, and service related elements.  We shall provide maintenance and restoration of public spaces, where applicable, by ensuring our multi-year accessibility plan includes procedures for preventative and emergency maintenance of accessible elements in public spaces and procedures for dealing with temporary disruptions when accessible elements required under this section are not in working order.</p>
<h3 id="regulatory-requirements">Regulatory Requirements</h3>
<p>An Administrative Monetary Penalties scheme is being established under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA).  The scheme will allow a director or a designate to issue an order against a person, organization or corporation to pay a penalty amount as a result of non-compliance with the AODA or the accessibility standards.  The largest penalty amount that can be issued to an individual or an organization that is not a corporation is $50,000.
Use of administrative monetary penalties will be considered an avenue of last resort when all other compliance assistance and improvement options have been exhausted
The License Appeal Tribunal (LAT) will hear appeals from organizations of director’s orders, but not individual complaints.  Individuals who feel their human rights have not been met would continue to complain to the Ontario Human Rights Commission.</p>
