			<h2 id="as-companies-grow-rapidly-management-often-grasps-for-process-as-a-way-to-deal-with-increasing-complexity-success-depends-on-their-ability-to-fight-this-urge-">As companies grow rapidly, management often grasps for process as a way to deal with increasing complexity. Success depends on their ability to fight this urge.</h2>
<p>There seems to be an insatiable urge in organizations beyond a certain size to succumb to process. In larger organizations this is generally called “bureaucracy”, but what I think is most interesting is how the slide from self-organization and improvisation to strictly defined processes happens.</p>
<p>Small companies are typically very agile and responsive to change. They can turn on a dime when circumstances change, willing and able to capitalize on opportunities.</p>
<p>But then they start to experience serious growth. Maybe it’s 50%, 100%, or 1000% - let’s say that 50%/annum is the threshold for “rapid” growth in a small company (after all, it’s easier to grow by half or more at $1 million in revenues than at $1 billion).</p>
<p>Along with rapid growth comes a certain degree of chaos. The owner or management team, accustomed to having complete knowledge and control over their operation, start to feel like things are slipping out of control – and often they are. People start missing deadlines, customer service worsens, and overall the work environment starts to resemble a hippo on a slip-n’-slide in a glass factory.</p>
<p>At about this point, a battle cry begins to emerge; slowly at first, but quickly building into a deafening roar:</p>
<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
<p>Now everything must be documented, planned, and measured! “It’s not about the results, it’s about the process,” managers will claim sagely. Marketing plans! Process diagrams! Knowledge management!</p>
<p>It’s easy to see how, over time, an emphasis on process over results can lead to what I would call a “catastrophic bureaucracy”, an organization that has created so many checks and balances in the name of process that, before it casts a shadow, it must first ensure that the sun is in the right position according to its ISO 9001-certified illumination charts.</p>
<p>And indeed, this is what happens. You get slow, lumbering organizations that are resistant to change and have lost their entrepreneurial edge. As Peter Drucker said, “Lack of management is the primary downfall of entrepreneurial firms, just as lack of entrepreneurship is the chief killer of large ones.”</p>
<p>I experienced this first hand in university one summer working at a large defence contractor . Everything had a place, every action a process, and there was even a process for defining and documenting processes (there were no fewer than 3 different process-standardization standards). The blue collar workers were unionized, which added another set of rules and processes. The result was as expected: things moved at a glacial pace. Any type of innovation not aligned with ironing out manufacturing defects through “Six Sigma” was scorned.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur-type by nature, I felt suffocated.</p>
<p>How, then, does one both maintain some semblance of consistent order while also promoting an entrepreneurial ethos and environment?</p>
<p>I would argue that there are three key attributes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Frameworks and communication over process;</li>
<li>Entrepreneurs over taskmasters, and;</li>
<li>Freedom over hierarchy.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="frameworks-and-communication-over-process">Frameworks And Communication Over Process</h3>
<p>Organizational learning is important. That’s why knowledge management and business process management are such huge industries.</p>
<p>The real issue I see, however, is that often processes are used as a substitute for communication. Rather than putting people in an environment where they are able to organically learn from others, quickly find people with the knowledge they need, and arrange teams in an ad-hoc way, the focus is instead put on defining processes and technological “systems” to manage the exchange of information.</p>
<p>We recently switched from what I would term “Hail Mary” development methodology to an agile, Scrum-based approach. We’re still ironing out the kinks (and I don’t expect them to ever be fully ironed out), but what I like about Scrum is that it is a Framework more than a process. It gives us the tools to self-organize and share knowledge within a multi-disciplinary team, rather than a formulaic plan and sequence of rigid steps we need follow. It’s simple, and most importantly it recognizes that real learning happens when people are in the same space at the same time working together with shared goals.</p>
<h3 id="entrepreneurs-over-taskmasters">Entrepreneurs Over Taskmasters</h3>
<p>This one is a bit harder, and it boils down to the type of people you work with. I don’t believe that entrepreneurs are necessarily born (I don’t buy the folklore - there are many different types of people who can succeed at it), but it does takes large dollops of self-motivation and the right attitude to make a process-free organization actually work. Netflix is a great example of this – they hire people who are self-motivated and, if they realize they made a mistake, they accept responsibility for making a bad choice and offer a generous severance package for that person to leave.</p>
<p>It’s better for the company, and it’s better for the employee. If they made it through the screening process, you can bet they are a smart cookie who will quickly recognize that they don’t belong.</p>
<p>One weird thing about self-motivation, however, is that it tends to be self-propagating. Plop a smart, hardworking individual into an environment where taking initiative is expected and, in most cases, they will rise to the challenge.</p>
<p>To be clear, however, no amount of initiative can make up for poor communication from the top. Everyone needs to know what their role is and what they should be doing. Organizational objectives should be clear, the purpose for the company to exist known.</p>
<p>Combine strong communication and trust in people’s ability to work on the right things, however, and you have all the raw materials you need for a lean, mean, self-motivating machine.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-over-hierarchy">Freedom Over Hierarchy</h3>
<p>This touches on the very foundation of the idea of “knowledge workers” – people need to be free to make decisions where they are qualified to do so. Decisions should be pushed down to where there is competence, not to where there is authority by way of fancy title or time spent in a position. Hierarchy should be fluid, based upon who is the most knowledgeable on a particular dimension.</p>
<p>Again, this requires that everyone is aligned on the business case – for example, if an engineer decides that battery weight on an electric car should be shed to improve handling characteristics (an implicit assumption that the business objective is to build a high-performance car) without being aware that the business case prioritizes long-range over high-performance, alignment has not been achieved. And while this example seems contrived, I am consistently how blown away by how widespread this type of dissonance actually is.</p>
<p>Freedom is what made Zappos a great company. Everyone down to the front-line support workers know exactly what Zappos stands for and can take the right course of action to support that mission. “We shipped you the wrong shoes? No need to check with my boss, here’s a new pair and a $50 credit for our store. Sorry about that!”</p>
<h3 id="a-final-caveat">A Final Caveat</h3>
<p>I recognize that yes, building tanks is a different world than building Facebook. What I don’t buy is that more exacting standards for precision, security, or compliance completely override any responsibility for management to encourage entrepreneurship and frameworks over mindless process.</p>
<p>A new breed of aerospace companies, like Elon Musk’s SpaceX, are proving that freedom and mission-critical systems are not mutually exclusive. This very concept is what has allowed them to create a new breed of simpler heavy launch vehicle at a fraction of the cost of similar vehicles from big firms like Boeing or Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>In the end, growing companies must fight tooth and nail against the slow (or sometimes rapid) creep of process. It’s the only way to prevent a small, nimble company from growing up to be slow and tepid beyond repair.</p>
<p><strong>How do you fight process creep?</strong></p>
