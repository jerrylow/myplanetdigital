## Mastery, to many technologists, is a goal unto itself. We laud our “jQuery gurus” but forget our “usability engineers.” 

Self-improvement for technologists is often motivated by the “hacker ethos.” We learn technologies because they're there and they're cool – why else would you learn them? Mastery, to many technologists, is a goal unto itself. We laud our “jQuery gurus” but forget our “usability engineers.”

### A sensitivity to user needs

All technologists who work on products should be at least equally motivated by a sense of mastery and a sensitivity to user needs. The most succinct way to describe what means is “usability.” A sensitivity to how our creations are used should inform the direction and focus of our growth.

This article mostly applies to front-end engineers or “full-stack” developers, but every technologist can benefit from understanding user needs.

### Why?

There are a few good reasons why you should care about users:

We have limited bandwidth in honing our skills. What users care about informs what to focus on to stay relevant.

Your boss, your clients, your non-technical co-workers and basically everyone who is not a technologist judges your success by the quality and workmanship of what you produce, not by your mastery of closures or lambda-functions.

How often have you over-engineered a solution because you wanted to master the technology, or out of pure pride? Or under-engineered because the remaining aspects of the solution were not as technically challenging? Focusing on user needs releases you from over- or under-engineering.

### How?

I spoke to usability expert and Myplanet collaborator Michael Keara (www.tuag.ca) on how to build a sensitivity to user needs. Michael has over 25 years of experience as usability expert. His advice? “Use yourself as a battering ram to see where the interface hurts.”

Technologists are in a privileged position when it comes to understanding what hurts. We live and breathe technology, and we understand what causes friction. The trick is holding your own creations to the same standard that you use for the products you consume.

Michael also suggested watching users attempt to use your product. It can be humiliating watching a non-technical user struggle with a product. It won't matter how beautifully optimized the back-end is, or what framework you used. In my experience, nothing will build your sensitivity more quickly.

Another important way we build this sensitivity is through inter-disciplinary collaboration. As a “full-stack” developer on a SCRUM team, I frequently need to interact with product owners and designers. Having to scrap the most technically elegant solution because it did not serve user needs as well as a less elegant implementation is very humbling. Having this happen again and again has gradually drilled the need to balance user needs and technical beauty into me.

### What makes great technologists

Being a technologist often comes with a certain pride – some (uninitiated in the “ars technica”) might call it ego. This is a natural consequence of dedication to acquiring and honing skills, regardless of the arena. It's very important for us to strive to hone our skills, but just as is important is why. Transfer that pride in yourself into a pride in what you create.
