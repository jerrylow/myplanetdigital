## Who I am

Hi! My name is Alex and I love helping people resolve their business questions while creating great products. I'm very involved in site development at Myplanet. One of big my interests is helping corporations of any size realize their business needs in software development and establish themselves as thought leaders in their industry.

## What I do

At Myplanet I work as backend and frontend developer, rarely I handle server-side of our projects. Usually we use Drupal as our skeleton and with JavaScript, CSS technologies we make projects awesome.
