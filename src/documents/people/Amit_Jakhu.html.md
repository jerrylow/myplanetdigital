## Who I Am

I am a designer who has a strong passion to solve problems for others. Although my primary focus is the art of design and solving problems, I try and aim to learn as many other fields as I can to advance my knowledge of the environment around me. This includes: front-end development, marketing, business, interaction and so on.

## What I do

I design user interfaces. My approach is to break down what the problem the client is having into the core issue which is the root cause of the problem. By doing so, you can start from ground zero on virtually any project and build a flexible system and story to solve real problems.
