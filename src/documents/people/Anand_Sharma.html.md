## Who I am

I'm an ex-dancer/dance-teacher trained fully trained in European Classical Ballet, Contemporary Ballet (Modern), Tap, Jazz and Kathak (a classical Indian dance form). I leapt my way into programming after a major back injury necessitated a change in career.

## What I do

As a Developer-Concierge, I receive all incoming client support requests providing our clients a superior support experience. Through direct interaction with clients via email, chat, phone and even video-call/screen-sharing I investigate how to best fulfill their goal. If the diagnosis indicates that it can be done quickly, I implement the solution and deploy it right away!
