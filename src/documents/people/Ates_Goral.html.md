## Who I am

I'm a polyglot programmer with an experience stretching from the low-level intricacies of bootsector assembly intros; to the high-level design patterns for bringing elegant architecture and designs to complex applications. I take pride in writing clean, consistent code.

I also dabble in fine arts, graphic design and music.

## What I Do

I think thrice, debate twice and code once.
