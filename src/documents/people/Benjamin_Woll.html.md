## Who I am

Early adopter! I like to test and play with new technologies before they have proven their worth. If you don’t quite know what you need or want I will help you refine it.  The intersection between technology and user experience is where you’ll find me.

## What I do

Driver of business value!  With agile methodologies as my cornerstone I seek to deliver creative solutions for enterprise companies in all product and technological aspects of business.  My focus is on fostering relationships to instill confidence and maximize value for our clients.
