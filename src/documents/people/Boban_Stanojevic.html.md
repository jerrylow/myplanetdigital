## Who I am

Who I am: I like to call myself experimental developer in everything web and desktop. Apart from having worked on many projects that involve using wide range of technologies, I am also prepping to get my Zend Certificate.

## What I do

What I do: Using Agile as guiding principle, I build and test any type of Web application. Raised on desktop programming in C/C++, I now write code using Javacript and PHP that works great with Drupal.
