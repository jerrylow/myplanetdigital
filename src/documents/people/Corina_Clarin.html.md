## Who I am

Corina's professional background is a mix of computer science, project management, entrepreneurship and finance.  Her passions come from working with amazing and dedicated Myplaneteers.  Corina's efforts are focused on cash flow management, treasury, accounting, enabling the growth of the organization and providing financial guidance to the director team at Myplanet.  She also focuses on "herding"... no, not cats..... Jason.

## What I do

When Corina's not at the Myplanet HQ working on the calculator, she's spending some quality time with her little boy Maxwell or baking cheesecakes.
