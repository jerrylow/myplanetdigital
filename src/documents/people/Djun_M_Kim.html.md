## Who I am

At any point in time, I'm some combination of programmer, mathematician, pianist, dancer, reader, writer...  I live in Vancouver, Canada. My first contribution to open source software was a bug fix for the video driver in Minix, one of the precursors to Linux. I'm the co-author of a book which is currently at #302,976 on the Amazon best seller list.

## What I do

I write software in a variety of environments and languages.  Some of this is directly user-facing; some is used to support the development process, in testing, continuous deployment, and analysis.
