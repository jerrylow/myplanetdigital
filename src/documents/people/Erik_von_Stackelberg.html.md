## Who I am

In one run-on sentence: I'm an aspiring designer-nerd/electronic-musician/bedroom-DJ/wannabe-illustrator/student-of-media-theory/proud Canadian & staunch civil society advocate. I cannot fit that on a business card, so I usually tell people I'm a user interface designer.

## What I do

My average day as Creative Director at Myplanet straddles the theoretical and practical, an ongoing mix of interactive and digital identity design for nonprofits, government, and large public companies; UX research; design team building; and Agile user experience process development. I believe in bottom-up creative direction, peer review, minimizing waste, and maximizing flexibility. I really like playing with websites.
