## Who I am

I adore cycling — it’s not only my transportation, but also my gym, my therapist and my contribution back to the environment. When I’m in the city, I ride fixed.

I do improv comedy — long and short form. I adore the spontaneity and the freedom of seeing a show unfold before your very eyes. I perform fantasy narrative with my troupe, Tomes, and frequent open-jams at Comedy Bar.

## What I Do

I love web development — working on both the software as a php developer and a product owner. I work at Myplanet.
