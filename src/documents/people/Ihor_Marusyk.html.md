## Who I am

Hi! My name is Ihor, I recently moved to Toronto from Ukraine to work at Myplanet. My interest in internet and web technologies developed unexpectedly: I wanted to become a designer and I thought that having a website is the most important thing in that enterprise. The amount of delight and joy that I was getting while learning about web was so big that I forgot the original reason for me to get into it. Probably the most important thing for me in web development is instant gratification, I see the result of my work almost immediately after making an effort. What can be more inspiring. 

I studied industrial electronics in state technological university in my hometown. This gave me strong background in technology and taught me how to acquire knowledge in more effective ways. 

## What I do

I like to answer to that with a short "I do websites". But that phrase is just a rabbit hole into all sorts of interesting and challenging problems that I have to deal with every day. I have to look at the problem from users perspective, I have to understand clients' needs, I must find a solution within limits of available technology, I need to come up with an approach to the problem that will guarantee quality, maintainability ease of delivery and high speed of development. Finding a solution often involves rapidly learning something new and using that on practice right away. Building software is a highly diverse challenging task and that's what I love about it. Wow that's probably too abstractedly. So to be more precise I work as a Drupal developer, recently leaning more towards javascript work namely nodejs and Angularjs. In 2014 I am also taking on a new role of mentor.
