## Who I Am

Originally from Pakistan, I have recently moved to Toronto with my family to work for myplanet. I have more than 12 years of professional work experience. My journey as an IT professional started back in 96 when I joined a software engineering degree program. Believe it or not, I had never touched a computer in my life before that so even after these many years it still feels like a dream. I started working with PHP in 2004-05. I am a ZEND Certified PHP engineer since 2007. During my free time, I love spending time with my family, doing yoga and going for walks. Ê

## What I do

At Myplanet, my primary responsibilities are to develop custom web applications using PHP. During my stint so far, I have had the opportunity to create great web solutions using drupal 7, magento, joomla, jquery and angularjs.Ê
