## Who I Am

Born in Jamaica, Jacques Ramphal has worked in the West Indies in print and advertising. In 2009, he moved to Toronto to study Graphic Design at OCAD U. He has been living and breathing Myplanet since graduating from the Fellowship program in early 2013.

## What I do

Jacques spends most of his days working on print, packaging and branding. When he's not doing that, Jacques is critiquing and learning from his peers.
