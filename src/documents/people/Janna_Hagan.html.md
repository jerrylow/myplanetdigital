## Who I am

My name is Janna Hagan, a user interface designer originally from Edmonton, Alberta. After graduating college, I went on to pursue my freelance career, which included clients such as the American National Breast Cancer Foundation. Even though I love to spend most of my time behind a computer screen, I've been playing competitive basketball and softball since I was 5, and love to practice yoga.

## What I do

 I am responsible for organizing and maintaining consistency throughout the Myplanet brand. I love mixing the opportunities of marketing and the creativity of design to provide meaningful and structured communications to our clients and the community.
