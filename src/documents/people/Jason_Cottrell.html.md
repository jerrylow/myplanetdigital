## Who I Am

Entrepreneur and recovering workaholic. They don't let me design or code anymore, but that's okay. I love the things our Myplaneteers accomplish, but my proudest moments are watching them just enjoy time with each other.ÃŠ

## What I do

We've got ambitious long-term goals, and very real short-term commitments. My job is to chart our path, set the priorities and keep our culture as Myplanet scales. I spend my time alongside our customers, teams and out in the industry.
