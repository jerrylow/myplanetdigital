## Who I am

At work I am a results-driven project management professional with over 14 years experience in the technology industry directing full cycles for complex projects and initiatives. By combining strategic and project management skills I am focused on client and team interactions that invoke process development, training, coaching and evaluation. … As you can tell, I'm REALLY SERIOUS.

## What I do

As a Product Owner at Myplanet my role is to drive the Product Vision and manage the project backlog for each initiative. I work hand-in-hand with the client to ensure that the product delivered is valuable, on-time and on-budget. I also help guide our strategic direction as a company, helping us set priorities about where we're heading over the next few years and how we can plan for it …  because I'm such a good planner. I'm awesome!
