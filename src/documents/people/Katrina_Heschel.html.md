## Who I Am

An Albertan at heart, and a British Columbian by spirit. My thirst for adventure is often quenched sailing high winds and stormy waters, and skiing powder while dodging snow ghosts. On quieter evenings I can be found adventuring with my pup, Toblerone, or teaching him a new trick.ÃŠ

## What I do

At MyPlanet, I empower Vancouver MyPlaneteers to engage and give back to the local tech community. 

I also work on making the Vancouver office an awesome place to come to every day, as well as maintain day-to-day operations of our little corner of the universe.
