## Who I am

A business leader and problem solver, as passionate about devising elegant and flexible strategies as building out and then executing on the tactical plans. A computer engineer by background, experienced business consultant with a focus on analytics, and former Product Owner; in my spare time I'm a (very) amateur triathlete and budding globetrotter.


## What I do

As Director of Operations, I am the primary link of Myplanet's professional services operations to our sales and finance functions. Ensuring that we are evolving and providing the right types of offerings, resourcing Myplanet to have the right skills and capabilities in the dynamic digital design and technology space, and creating a scalable environment that enables strong execution are some of the challenges that I get to work on every day.
