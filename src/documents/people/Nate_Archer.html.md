## Who I am

Born in Toronto, Nate Archer studied industrial design in his hometown and Amsterdam, and worked in Milan before coming back to Toronto to join Myplanet in 2011. He has a strange sense of humour, drinks black coffee and rides his bike in the winter.

## What I do

Nate is a thinker and doer who believes in designing the change you wish to see in the world. He spends his days conducting design research, synthesizing findings and designing interactions for great digital products. He's passionate about solving wicked problems and advocating for user centered design.
