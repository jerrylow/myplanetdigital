## Who I am

Hello there! I am Pavel and I am Myplanet team member from Ukraine.

Graduated from Chernihiv State Technological University and have Master’s degree in Special Computer Systems.

Always looking for an opportunity to create something modern and useful. This led me to the computer industry. The first site I created with a group of friends, and that was enough to interest me in web development. Already during the year I became a member of Aсropolium team and a year later - Myplanet.


## What I do

Work at Myplanet more than a year as a Drupal developer. I’ve started my way as a member of Strategy and Support group, and was soon involved to newly created B-team, which is now called DDF. I am doing as a backend and frontend parts of projects. Always love js-frontend interaction stuff and new challenges in every kind of work.
