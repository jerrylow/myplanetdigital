## Who I am

Given my penchant for skepticism, I suppose I should identify myself first as a thinking being, and provide the caveat that everything that follows might well be a figment of my imagination. With that out of the way, I am a philosophically-minded, perpetually-bearded individual. I've sailed through hurricanes with the Canadian Navy, spent more than 12 hours on the floor of the Indira Gandhi International Airport layover terminal, and contracted amoebic dysentery in Cambodia, so I am well-versed in painful experiences, which drives my passion to make structured human experiences less painful and more pleasant.

## What I do

Ideally, I weave coherent and meaningful narratives out of the chaotic jumble of desires, goals, constraints, and conflicting viewpoints that so frequently characterize nascent digital products to yield tangible artefacts like interaction models and wireframes. I subsequently subject these artefacts to testing and evaluation to ensure that those narratives are actually coherent and meaningful from the situated perspectives of the people that matter most â€“ the end users.
