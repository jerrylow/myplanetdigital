## Who I am

I'm a remote worker located in a small town northern New Brunswick, where I spend my days trying to be the best dad and husband I can be. Photography and training dogs (we have two) are my main passions and creative outlets outside of work. 


## What I do

I consider my job at Myplanet to try and deliver the designers' vision to fruition. I particular enjoy meeting that challenge while trying to keep the markup as clean and rich as possible to maximize accessibility and long-term viability.
