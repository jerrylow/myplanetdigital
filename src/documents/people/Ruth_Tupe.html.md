## Who I am

I'm all about realising creative and people potential. With my background in design and HR, I'm interested in designing peopleâ€™s experiences, in order to foster more productive and positive work relationships. I'm interested in nurturing team dynamics, mentoring personal development, and creating a culture of learning.
 
Although I was born in the Middle East and raised on a small tropical island called the Philippines, I mostly grew up in Canada all over the GTA. I studied at Ryerson University and majored in Graphic Communications Management and minored in Human Resources. I freelanced as a graphic designer but delved deeper into the world of technology when I launched two Nuit Blanche exhibitions that featured open source wearable technology, such as the EyeWriter device. Needless to say, the internet of things intrigues me and also how communications is evolving and shaping our society. It's interesting to see how technology impacts our behaviours and forms our habits.

On a side note, I have a strong interest in politics, world issues, history, philosophy, and music. I also a foodie and a coffee addict, both of which fuel my creative energy.
 
## What I do

It's exciting to identify and develop talent and have had my hand in recruiting in the past year. I'm proud to be a part of building the talented roster at Myplanet and helping the company grow. I enjoy identifying needs and developing processes to support and sustain the talented folks here.

My journey here is to continue exploring how design can impact organizations and systems. My current focus at Myplanet is to develop people potential and to create a culture of learning. Being a part of team Eduardo, we offer educational initiatives within and outside the Myplanet sphere. The goal is to train others on our practices and methodologies and to foster multi-disciplinary learning. I redeveloped the Fellowship program in 2013 and proud to expand the program with the team across Canada. We're also spinning up new programs such as World of Webcraft and finding more engaging ways to teach and educate about design and development.
