## Who I am

After completing engineering in computer science, I moved to Toronto from Dubai looking to make my mark. As any ambitious youngster, I was in search for an opportunity that would allow me to utilize my skills effectively and lay foundations to a modest career. I've always had an interest in Technology and turning this fascination to a long term pursuit is a decision I am proud of. 

Apart from technology, I have a huge passion for Cricket and enjoy getting out there for a game myself now and then.

## What I do

At Myplanet, I work as a QA Analyst. As a member of an agile team, I work closely with the developers to provide meaningful evaluation of ongoing work. Off the job, I enjoy learning new technologies and keep myself updated. I strongly believe that staying updated with new trends and developments is key to be successful in any capacity; but particularly so in the case of software industry which has expanded exponentially in the past decade.
