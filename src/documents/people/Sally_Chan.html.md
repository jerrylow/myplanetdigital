## Who I Am

Sally moved to Toronto from Vancouver to study industrial and graphic design, and continues to find new interest in other disciplines. With an appetite for big ideas and an eye for small details, she believes in design's ability to impact social behaviours in delightful and powerful ways. But beware, she's also known for laughingÊat her own jokes, but ruining your's by asking you to explain them.


## What I do

As a designer at Myplanet, Sally can be found conducting user research, translating insights and visually communicating solutions to problems that are complex and broad in scope. What she finds the most challenging and exciting is helping guide multidisciplinary teams to make informed decisions by focusing on human-centred design methodologies.Ê
