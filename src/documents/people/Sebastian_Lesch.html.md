## Who I am

Seb is a bassist (check out his band "Convoys"!) who enjoys his craft brewery. When he's not watching Fight Club or the Sound of Music, he is following a range of bands including Death Grips, Grimes and Nirvana.

## What I do

Seb recently switched roles from being a drupal developer, to curriculum/program developer on EDUardo. Helping to build our Winter 2014 Fellowship program and spearheading the pilot program for World of Webcraft. There's a lot of new ground to break when it comes to education at Myplanet: exciting times! 

Education in any context is a challenging thing do deliver effectively and deliberately, so Seb finds his motivation in the #puglife.
