## Who I am

I'm a full-stack web technologist and Agile practitioner. I'm drawn to how Agile respects humanity in the way we work while producing better outcomes.
I'm a Certified ScrumMaster and I hold a Hons. B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Toronto.


## What I do

I employ my technical skills alongside Agile to improve quality, efficiency, and value delivery in team settings. My technical specialities are PHP, JavaScript, QA Automation, and Drupal. I have a strong focus on QA and integrating QA into Agile teams.
