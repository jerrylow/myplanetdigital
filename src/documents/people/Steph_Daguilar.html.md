## Who I am

I am a hard-working and passionate person who is a sports enthusiast. I enjoy playing soccer, volleyball and ultimate frisbee on my free time.

My true passion is cooking. I love the way that good food can bring people together in a way that nothing else can. 


## What I do

At Myplanet, I work as a Business Development Consultant. I am tasked with researching and reaching out to potential customers to discuss how Myplanet can help them build beautiful digital products. I also work with existing clients to nurture and grow their relationship with Myplanet and ensure that the client is satisfied.
