## Who I am

I am a curious Engineer who most enjoys bringing groups of brilliant people together to accomplish things of scale and quality that otherwise couldnâ€™t have been done on their own.

## What I do

I work with our technologist to keep a constant eye on the horizon of technological advances as it relates to the digital products of our current and future clients. Further, I work with others interested in business strategy at Myplanet to continuously develop our abilities as it relates to the reach and impact of our work, mastery of our craft and happiness of our Myplaneteers.
