## Who I am

My name is Yuriy Savenko, but I'm better known as Yoshi.
I was born and grew up in Ukraine, in a small city of Chernihiv. During my lifetime in Ukraine I studied Computer Science, Art and Economics. Over the last 10 years I founded a couple of IT teams/companies as well as always learning and improving my hard skills as a specialist. My credo is: you can understand other people much better after you try to live their lives. So during my career I wore a lot of hats by being developer, designer and businessman.

## What I do

I am Frontend developer and Creative lead at Myplanet. I am also a remote buddy for our team back in Ukraine - trying to keep remote guys connected, informed and motivated FTW.
