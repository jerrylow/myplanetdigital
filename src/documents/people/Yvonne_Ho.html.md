## Who I am

An idealist who believes that design has the power to influence and inspire change. I studied at the York University-Sheridan College Joint Program in Design, and enjoy creating beautifully useful things that are infused with warmth and personality. When I'm not designing, I like to marathon seasons of television (especially dark and raw sci-fi), consume *literal* bowls of tea, and read big books under comfy blankets.

## What I do

I aim to emphasize the positive social impact of digital products by mastering my craft, building empathy with users, and pursuing surprise and delight in everything that I create.
