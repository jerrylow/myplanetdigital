## Who I am

I’m a Torontonian that fell in love with the power of photography to create stories and express a point of view. I’m also an analyst that uses numbers to pose and answer questions about the world around us.


## What I do

I help remove obstacles as a Scrum Master on the Strategy and Support Group. I help the team to work towards their goals by making sure that they have all the tools required to do their job, hiding distractions and acting as a gatekeeper.  I also enable the team to understand their progress by reporting on capacity and velocity.
