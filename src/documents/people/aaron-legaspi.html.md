## Who I am

A designer with a passion for mobile-everything. Creator of clean, minimal, and usable designs. Lover of soul, RnB, hip hop, and jazz music. 

## What I do

At Myplanet, I design user interfaces that enable people to achieve their goals with the utmost satisfaction. If I'm not in photoshop, I'm usually surfing dribbble or reading popular design blogs. Â
