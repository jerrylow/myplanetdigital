## Who I am

I am a QA geek who belives 'Quality is built-in' and it needs to be improved with every new iteration of the software. I like to play with new applications and find faults early in the stage of development to ensure its quality. Automation testing is something which fasinates me and make my job cooler. If you need to plan your project for test efforts I AM YOUR GUY! 

## What I do

I do everything that a QA has to do on a project and also help other QAs in achieving their day-to-day tasks.
