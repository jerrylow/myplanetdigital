## Who I Am

I have been working for Myplanet since 2012 remotely from Chernihiv, Ukraine. I have M. S. in Computer Science from Chernihiv State Technology University. In my free time I enjoy reading sci-fi books, learning history and picking up new languages.

## What I do

At Myplanet I work as a Drupal developer on the Strategy and Support Team. I always enjoy taking on new challenges, and learning anything related to Javascript.
