## Who I am

I was born and raised on the West Coast, and my career has brought me to live/work from many cities of the world including NYC, London, Paris, Singapore and Hong Kong. I come from a diverse career in IT, having worked at two startups, an ERP software company and most recently a lengthy career at a Big-4 accounting firm. After living in Amsterdam for three years I have finally settled in the city with the most loyal NHL hockey fans in the world.  I once tried to escape IT by taking a year of culinary arts training.  Instead of becoming a celebrity chef, my skills are now put to work on gourmet meals fit for a foodie at home served to family and friends.  One little known fact about me is that I once won an amateur salsa competition with my now wife, and had a brief stint as a semi-professional salsa dancer both teaching and performing in my spare time.

## What I do

As a Product Owner I partner with our client stakeholders to help set the vision for the product or project we are delivering on. I collaborate with a cross-functional team of developers, designers, and a Scrummaster to deliver on-time and on-budget.
