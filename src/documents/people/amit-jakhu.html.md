## Who I am

I am a designer who has a strong passion in solving problems for others through Visual Interface Design. Although this is my primary focus, I enjoy learning aspects of front-end development, marketing, business, and interaction.

## What I do

I design user interfaces. My approach is to break down and understand the problem, come up with various methods to solve the problem and then validate the design decisions with users and ensure it solves the business needs. I love working on products from ground zero, building flexible systems that tell a story.
