## Who I am

I am a traveler, explorer, movie lover (& hater), engineer, user experience designer, fantasy sports kick-asser, scotch drinker (neat, please), product owner, & experimenter.

But not always in that order.


## What I do

The same thing I do every night Pinky... try to teach the world the value of a great user experience.

While I don't have the solution quite yet, it requires me to do a bit of: doing > strategizing, UX designing, white-boarding, sticky noting, traveling, client managing, learning, design researching, knowledge sharing, experimenting, motivating, inspiring, and of course project managing.
