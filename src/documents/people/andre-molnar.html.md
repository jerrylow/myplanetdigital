## Who I am

I am a senior technical lead / problem solver with an anything-is-possible can-do attitude. I'm highly flexible in what I do in the day to day operations of Myplanet and am as comfortable in an architect role as I am in a product development and ownership role.  Outside of the office, I'm an avid concert goer that loves seeing smaller shows at any number of Toronto venues.  To relax and to flex creative muscle, I draw and paint.

## What I do

I've been working with both open and closed systems to develop web based applications for over a decade. For what its worth, I'm an agile practitioner with scrum certifications, but I'm hardly dogmatic about any one school of thought. Whatever it takes to get it done right.  That might sound like a cop out as an answer but I'm 100% dedicated to the success of the projects I'm involved in.

Ultimately, I am paid to apply critical judgement to complex technical and real world problems.
