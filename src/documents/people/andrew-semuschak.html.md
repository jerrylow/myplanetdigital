## Who I am

I'm a Canuck who currently lives in Washington D.C., enjoys smooth jazz and empanadas.

## What I do

I create pretty things for the web, build useful things that someone else should have already built, and love a perfectly cooked lemon ricotta pancake more than Putin loves his morning cocktail.
