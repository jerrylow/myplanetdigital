## Who I Am

 Hi, I'm Anna and I work remotely from Chernihiv, Ukraine. I have a M. S. in Computer Science from Chernihiv State Technology University. I've been working for Myplanet since 2012. In my free time I enjoy travelling and learning languages.

## What I do

At Myplanet I work as a member of Strategy and Support Group. I enjoy working in the team and sharing knowledge inside the group. I like facing challenges and learning new technologies.
